        "\n",
        "Ans.  OOP is a programming language paradigm or style that organize software design around data, or objrcts,rather than functions and logic. In OOP ,objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints for creating objects.\n",

        "Here are some key concepts in OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Class**: A blueprint or template for cretaing objects. It defines the properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Object**:An instance of a class. It contains data and methods that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation**: The concept of bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also refers to restricting access to some of the object's components to prevent unintended interface and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inheritance**: A way to create a new class by using an existing class. The new class,called the child class, inherits properties and methods from the parent class. Inheritance allows for code reusability and creating  a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism**: The ability of  a method, function, or object to take on many forms. In OOP ,this typically means that diffrent classes can define the same method in thier own way, and correct method will be called based on the object's type.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary features. This heps in simplifying interactions with objects and focusing on high-level functionality."

In the context of OOP ,polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables methods to behave differently based on the object they are acting upon, enhancing flexibilty and scalabilty.\n",

        "1. **Flexibility and Reusability:**Polymorphism enables you to write code that can work with objects of different classes withot knowing the exact class of the object. You can write generic code and pass objects of different types, yet the right method or behaviour will be applied based on the object type. This makes your code more flexible and reusable.\n",

Since polymorphism allows for the same interafce to be used for different types, you cab add new subclasses with their own specific behaviour without modifying the code that uses polymorphism."

        "Ans. In Python, polymorphism refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance, even though they may implement different methods. It allows a single function, method , or operator to work with different types of objects. This is typically achieved using method overriding, where a subclass provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",

This is possible because each method call returns the object itself, enabling subsequent methods calls to be \"chained \" together.\n",
